# Daily Timed Schedule

## Function
The function of this library is to create a routine/daily homework schedule for the user with specific time periods allotted for certain subjects based on class difficulty and time for breaks, naps, and procrastination as well. 

The user will input: 
* Each class's level of difficulty (select from below options) 
  * Easy but time-consuming 
  * Easy and quick 
  * Medium
  * Hard, tedious, and time-consuming 
  * Hard material, quick work 
* The type of assignment for that class
  * Homework
  * Graded Assessment
  * Paper or Project
* List of assignments due at midnight (daily input)
* List of assignments due before class the next day (daily input) 

The program will then create a color-coordinated schedule for the day with the information the user provided with appropriate time slots for activities.  

## Features to Create:
* GUI to show color co-ordinated schedule 
* Algorithm to discern how to create schedule based on time committments 
* Separate Accessibility feature for Teacher 

## Recommended Help:
1) Ideas to improve the correlation between class difficulty and time required
2) Ways to reduce the time the user spends inputting data everyday (auto-saving previous answers?)
3) Ways to maintain organization of classes and files in the library
